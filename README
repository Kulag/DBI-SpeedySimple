DBI-SpeedySimple version 0.01
=============================

DBI::SpeedySimple is a very simplistic interface for DBI that aims to simplfy
and speed up writing common database calls.

The main differences from the helper functions found within DBI itself are: 
 - usage of prepare_cached rather than prepare
 - the ability to load a table into a transparent cache in RAM to speed access
 - functions are not called with SQL queries but the table name and a somewhat
   more perlish representation of data. Substitutions are handled for you.
 - it assumes the database uses utf8, encoding everything it sends and decoding
   everything it receives as utf8.
